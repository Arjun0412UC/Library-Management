This is a basic Library Management system for a school or a university with functions for Admins to add and remove books, for students and professors to borrow and return books. It also calculates a fine for late 
return of the books. 
The Library uses an SQL DBMS to store the various inputs and to perform the functions.
The Python overlay is just a basic Menu Based program that helps navigate the system.
