This is a basic Library Management system for a school with functions for Admins to add and remove books, for students and teachers to borrow and return books. It also calculates a fine for late 
return of the books. 
The Library uses an SQL DBMS to store the various inputs and to perform the functions.
There is a basic Menu driven Python overlay for the program as well as a GUI based program within Python itself. 
The GUI uses the tkinter module to use its various widgets to make a smoother experience for the user.
